# Hand Crank

First, a simple hand crank mechanism was made, which comprised of a cam that jumped up and down as the shaft was rotated. Then, a slider was added to this mechanism with the help of a crank and a connecting rod. The movement of the slider was restricted to a linear motion while the crank rotated in a circular motion. Once the mechanism seemed to work smoothly when run by hand, a motor was connected to the mechanism. 

## Video 

Below is the video of the hand crank mechanism run by hand.

Below is the video of the hand crank mechanism running for 60 seconds after attaching a motor to run it.

## Problems faced

One of the problems that I faced initially was the slider moving in different directions than expected, such as a left-to-right motion. To prevent this, I attached a support on either sides of the table that was placed as the base for the slider to slide on. This pevented the slider from moving in directions other than which it was supposed to and made sure that the slider moved in the correct linear motion. After this problem was fixed, another issue that I faced was that the slider seemed to rise up from the table from the side that was not connected to the connecting rod when it moved away from its support table. To solve this issue, I just decided to make the slider heavier on the particular side by stacking multiple pieces of cardboard just on that side of the slider. The images for both the solutions are below.
