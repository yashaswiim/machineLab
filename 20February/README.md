# First Draft of Imaginary Mechanism for the Clock

### Three different levels of activity for the quarter, half, and full hour
For my mechanism for the clock, my idea is as follows:

**Quarter hour**

There will be a plate that is rotatable and has four equidistant boxes placed on its circumference. These boxes will be labeled as "00", "15", "30" and "45" to represent every quarter of the hour. The plate will rotate a quarter of a circle every quarter hour to bring the box in the front that corresponds to the number of minutes past the hour. This will be my quarter hour mechanism for the clock - rotation of the plate.

**Half hour**

Inside the box labeled "30", there will be a crankshaft-slider mechanism, one similar to the first project we made in class. The difference will be that in place of a simple slider, there will be a mallet-like structure that will slide back and forth. There will be a gong attached to the wall of the box and the entire mechanism will be placed inside the box such that when the mallet slides, it hits the gong and produces sound. This will create the half hourly mechanism for the clock, where we can hear the sound of the gong being hit by the mallet every half hour.

**Full hour**

Inside the box labeled "00", there will be a mechanism similar to the extending punching glove but instead of the punching glove it will hold something else that signifies the hour that just started and instead of placing it as a side-to-side movement that comes out of the side of the box, it will be placed such that it comes out of the top of the box in an up and down movement. For the rought first draft, I am imagining it to be an LCD that displays the hour like "12:00" that is attached to the extending arm mechanism. When the box labeled "00" comes to the front, the LCD would spring from the top of the box, stay for a while and go back in.

### Achieving the motions
For all three machanisms, motors will be required. In the quarter hourly mechanism, a motor is needed to rotate the plate. In the half hourly mechanism, a motor is needed to automatically move the hand-crank mechanism every half hour so that the slider (mallet) will slide (hit the gong) when necessary. In the full hourly mechanism, a motor is required to spring the extending arm mechanism out of the box when the hour starts.

### Types of motors and sensors needed
DC motors can work well for the hand-crank-slider mechanism as we have seen in class. Servo motors can be used for the extending arm mechanism because 180 degrees movement would be sufficient for this mechanism and finally for the rotating plate, a stepper motor can be used as it would give excellent position accuracy. Its lower speed compared to other motors would not be an obstruction here because we would not want the plate to rotate very fast anyways.

For sensors, we could use position sensors to track the quarter of a circle for the rotating plate and to track when the LED of which box is to be lit up. 

### Audio and visuals (LEDs) effects
The LED on each box and the LCD display would give visual effects to the piece. Meanwhile the gong and mallet would give audio effects. We can also think add a mechanism later to enhance the sound of the gong.

### Inspiration
My idea is inspired from the various projects we have made/seen in class such as the hand-crank mechanism that we built and the extending arm mechanism prototype that was shown to us.
