### Nemo Gould

This paper is about Nemo Gould, a contemporary American artist and sculptor, widely known for his kinetic found-object sculptures that comprise intricate and imaginative designs made from salvaged materials, such as, discarded gadgets, broken tools, outdated machinery, scrap metals and aluminum, and other objects that have lost their value in daily life. He builds each one of his sculptures as unique characters with personalities based on the materials used to build them. These materials are usually obsolete objects that are carefully re-contextualized to be parts of the sculpture. As he deconstructs and reassembles parts of the old objects, he creates a whole of a new character. It is his specialty to create new meaning out of the obsolete and he describes this process as “putting together a puzzle”.
